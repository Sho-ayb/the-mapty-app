## Project Title

The-Mapty-Project

## Description

The Mapty Project was developed to learn Javascript as part of Jonas Schmedtmanns course: The Complete Javascript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert. [Udemy link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24B)

In this Github repository you will find the code for the Mapty Project. The complete javascript course comes with a template for the mapty application, but I started from the beginning using the Cube CSS methodology from Andy Bell and Hayden Pickering: [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/), this project also utilises webpack version 5 for the project setup and final build. 

There are two branches that contain two different versions of the Mapty Project: In the "main" branch you will find code related to functional programming paradigm and in branch "app-using-class-based-paradigm" uses class-based programming paradigm. I did this to understand the difference between the two paradigms and to see which one is better for the Mapty Project. 

Overall I feel the class based paradigm is more suitable for the Mapty project, only because of the ability to create a workout from a class Workout and inherit properties and methods.


### What is Leafletjs?

This project utilises the Leaflet Javascript library to create a map with a workout form: [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/)

Leafletjs is a JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works with a large number of plugins and is compatible with a wide range of browsers. 

### What is the Mapty Project?

The Mapty Project is a simple application that allows users to add a workout to a map. The application uses the Leaflet Javascript library to create a map with a workout form. The user can click anywhere on the map to add a new workout to the map. The workout form includes fields for workout name, workout type, workout duration, workout distance, and workout elevation. The user can also delete a workout from the map. The application saves the workout data to local storage and the user's workout data will persist on the map when the page is refreshed.



## Installation

To install the Mapty Project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sho-ayb/The-Mapty-Project.git
cd The-Mapty-Project
npm install
```

## Guidelines

The Mapty Project was developed using the following guidelines:


## Usage

Click anywhere on the map and complete the workout form to add a new workout to the map. 

## Testing the Application

Add as many new workouts to the map, click on the workout in the sidebar to see the map move to the map marker. Delete a workout and the workout and map marker will be removed from the map. Refresh the page with saved workouts and your workouts will still persist on the map.
